Question 6

You may implement this part of the test outside of jsFiddle and 
return the files either through:

Email: zip the files up and send to david@solidstategroup.com
Git: Just send me a link 
Host: If you have a lot of spare time on your hands
----------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a page using a framework of your choice 
(backbone/angular/etc) that displays a list of films in 
alphabetical order that can be filtered by company name.  

You do not have to style the list or do anything fancy
just something along the lines of the below screenshots.
